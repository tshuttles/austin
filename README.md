# Austin

Welcome to the Austin CLI! This is my first project as a Flatiron Student. 

This application pulls information from Trip Advisor's Banff website https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attractions-g30196-Activities-Austin_Texas.html, which lists 30 different attractions that Austin, Texas, has to offer! Austin is a great, quickly-developing city filled with great food, culture, history, and tech. Find out which attractions you're interested in most and then make your dream trip a reality!

## Usage

After you run 'ruby bin/austin', read the welcome message and then follow the prompt from there!

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
